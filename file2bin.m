function file2bin(fileInput, fileOutput)
% FILEBIN converts a mat, smr, or smrx  file into a binary file to be read
% by Kilosort. It is unclear to me if this step is absolutely necessary,
% but for now it seems helpful. This function takes the path for a data
% file from the lab and saves it in a binary format for Kilosort in the
% (optional) fileOutput path. One limitation of this function is that it
% will not be able to import a analysis.mat file to a binary format. This
% is due a concept incompatibility. The analysis file contains structures
% with different data types and not only signals. This issue includes the
% unability to save the sampling frequency. One solution to this problem
% might be that the sampling frequency is at the very beguinning of the
% file, in the first channel, in the first position.
